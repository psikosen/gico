# GICO - Fixed Version

This version of GICO has been updated to fix issues with:
1. The Tauri API imports
2. Database schema inconsistencies
3. Button responsiveness
4. Event listeners

## Important Changes

### Using the Correct Tauri API Pattern

Instead of using import statements that can fail in certain environments, this version uses:

```javascript
// Access Tauri API directly from window object
import { invoke } from './tauri-bridge.js';
```

This ensures compatibility regardless of how the app is bundled or served.

### Fixed Database Schema

The application now uses a consistent schema for the Conversations table, including:
- `id`
- `title`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`
- `bookmarked`

### Enhanced Logging

Comprehensive logging has been added throughout the application to make troubleshooting easier.

### Diagnostic Tools

New diagnostic functions are available in the browser console:
- `window.runDiagnostics()` - Run all diagnostics
- `window.attemptFixes()` - Attempt to fix common issues
- `window.diagnoseSendButton()` - Check the send button specifically

## Known Issues

If you still encounter issues, try these steps:

1. **Button Issues**: Make sure the send button properly cycles through states (activate → waiting → activated).
   - Use `window.diagnoseSendButton()` for diagnostics.

2. **Database Errors**: If you see schema errors, clear your database or reinstall the app.

3. **Event Listeners**: If clicks don't register, use `window.attemptFixes()` to repair listeners.

## Development Guide

For developers making changes:

1. Always use the `invoke` function from `tauri-bridge.js`
2. Be careful with database schema changes
3. Use the logger for debugging: `logger.debug('message', {...data})` 
4. Test all buttons after making changes
